This chapter goes over the ability to create custom models, custom metrics, layers, etc. in Tensorflow with the backend low-level API. We also learn about how Numpy data types are the root of tensors in TensorFlow and how they can be properly interchanged. There is a short section on other TensorFlow data structures like Tensor arrays, string tensors and sets that can prove useful depending on the task at hand. Most of the chapter is creating customer activation functions, regularizers, metrics, layers and complete models using the API and then towards the end of the chapter we look at how to properly trace TF functions and the "Do's and Don't's" of TF Functions (TF Function Rules).
More details on the content for this chapter can be found in the jupyter notebook for this chapter.
