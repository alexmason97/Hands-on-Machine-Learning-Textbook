Chapter 14 is about CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), their network architure, how they work and common methods for implementation. This chapter was filled with a lot of useful information included famous CNN architectures and their respective academic papers like LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGGNet, and Xception networks. We also talk about strides in CNNs, filters and pooling and why you may choose to add these features to your models. Towards the end of the chapter, we implement a CNN model in TensorFlow with Keras and also use a pretrained model example with transfer learning. Overall, this chapter was incredibly well written and the content in this chapter was my favorite from the entire book. 
More details on the topics, content and code for this chapter can be found in the jupyter notebook associated to Chapter 14.
