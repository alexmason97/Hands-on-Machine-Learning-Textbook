This chapter is the start of the second half of this textbook primarily dealing with Neural Networks and Deep Learning. This chapter is a brief but effective introduiction to Neural Networks and how they can be implemented in Keras. We talk about artificial neurons and how the brain works processing information with firing neuron activations and then move onto the "baseline" neural network: The Perceptron. We then move onto the work of Geoffrey Hinton and the backpropagation algorithm which was a huge step forward for kickstarting the rebirth of neural network implementations. The rest of this chapter mainly focuses on setting up your jupyter notebook environment with TensorFlow and Keras so you can begin building neural networks using either the sequential API or the functional API. There are also some other sections on callbacks, saving models and fine tuning hyperparameters in a model and selecting the type of algorithms available for convergence in the network. 
More of what is covered in this chapter in the jupyter notebook for this section.
