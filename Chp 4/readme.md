Chapter 4 focuses on all things regression. Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression and Logistic Regression. One of the most important concepts in how a model improves is discussed in this chapter as well: Gradient Descent. There is a discussion of the different variations of gradient descent such as batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch gradient descent and the usefulness of each and why you might choose one over the other in a given situation. There is also a section on softmax regression and how a softmax regressor works for multi classification for data where there is more than one answer required to be answers for classification. There is an introduction to learning curves with gradient descent and how they can be improved and what methods can be used to speed up gradient descent, or even improve the accuracy of the mdoel you are training. Overall, a very well written chapter filled with tons of examples and explanations used to fully grasp the concept of regression modeling.
