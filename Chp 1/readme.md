This chapter goes over the fundamentals of machine learning and how to think about it logically as opposed to a "Deadly Terminator Robot." There are some general definitions in this chaper and explanations as to why it is useful and some of it's applications like classification, predictive modeling and data segmentation. This chapter also includes a framework about how processes can be automated and evaluated in applications and in a business using machine learning solutions. There is also the explanation between supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and the important distinctions between the two of them and how the learn and operate. Lastly, the author talks about problems that can arise with data like bias, variance, models taking too long to train, etc. and what methods can be used to assist with this (EX. using Hyperparameter tuning to assist with a model that overshoots the optimal solution too frequently. Overall, this was a great introduction to the textbook and gave valuable lessons about how to think logically about solving these types of problems.
