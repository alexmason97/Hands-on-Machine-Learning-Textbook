Chapter 9 in the textbook is all about Unsupervised Learning Techniques. The first point of discussion in this chapter is K-Means Clustering and how the algorithm works and based on the value of K, that is the about of clusters that will be created in an unsupervised manner. There are examples on how to use clustering for labeling unlabeled data (semi-supervised learning), Image Segmentation (breaking up an image into multiple segments) and how to use K-Means as a pipeline step to cluster the data for another algorithm such as SVMs or Logisitic Regression. The end of the clustering section ends off with mention of other clustering algorithms such as BIRCH, Mean-Shift and Spectral clustering. We also talk about Gaussian Mixtures and how they assist with Anomaly detection or outlier detection for outliers in a dataset like say for fraudulent credit card charges. 
More of this is discussed and implemented in the jupyter notebook for this section.
