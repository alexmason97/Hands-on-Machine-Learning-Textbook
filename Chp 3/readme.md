Chapter 3 focuses on classification models like logistic regression alone with other key methods used for performance like k-fold cross-validation, understanding a confusion matrix and how to properly evaluate one, what precision and recall are and how you determine which is more important for the task you are solving with your machine learning solution, and what an ROC curve is and how it can be used with precision and recall to get a better grip of how your model is performing. The MNIST number dataset is used for a binary classification problem between 2 numbers in the set and the rest of the chapter focuses on error analysis and how to determine what errors were sprung from your model and why and then finally we work with multioutput classification with all the digits in the dataset.
